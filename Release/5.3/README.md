# Rship-Unreal

Rocketship's Unreal Engine integration is facilitated by the Rship-Unreal plugin.

## Quickstart

### Installation

1. Download the plugin from [releases](https://docs.rship.io/releases)
2. Create a 'Plugins' folder inside a UE project directory and place the extracted folder there
3. Restart Unreal
4. In the plugins manager (Edit > Plugins), search for the 'RshipExec' plugin and verify it exists and is active (checked on)
5. Open the Unreal project settings (Edit > Project Settings) and search for the 'Rship Exec' plugin
6. Enter the address of the Rocketship server you wish to connect to in the 'Rocketship Host' field. Also set the 'Service Color' :)
7. Currently the rship connection management lives in the RshipTarget blueprint component. Create a Target to establish a connection with rship

### Usage

#### Create a Target

1. Add an RshipTarget component to any Actor blueprint
2. Name the Target in the Actor properties pane (in the level editor).
3. In the Editor Details pane, select the RshipTarget component and click 'Register' or 'Reconnect'

#### Create an Action

1. Create a function in the Actor blueprint. **Make sure to prefix the function name with RS_** to add it to the Actor's Target 
2. Edit the function arguments to define an Action Schema, which determines the data structure required for triggering the Action

3. Connect the RS function to some other function

#### Create an Emitter

1. Create an event dispatcher in the Actor blueprint. **Make sure to prefix the event dispatcher name with RS_** to add it to the Actor's Target
2. Edit the event dispatcher properties to define an Emitter Schema, which determines the data structure pulsed by the Emitter

### Current Limitations

Due to some pesky aspects of Unreal's implementation of C++, we are still working out the following limitations:

- Emitter Schema Size: 
    - An Emitter Schema can have at most 32 properties. 

- Unsupported Data Types:  
    - Vector, Rotation, and Position (note these structures can be easily decomposed into floats)

## Targets, Actions, and Emitters


| Targets          | Emitters                                  | Actions                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Actors**       | - Any Event dispatcher Parameter          | - Any Function Argument  |
